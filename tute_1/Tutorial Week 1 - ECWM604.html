			<h3>Week 1 Tutorial</h3>
			<div class="well">
			<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p>
				<p>Write a PHP program that receives an address as a single string.  The program should then, using a loop, print out the address one line at a time in a webpage.  For example, if the address as a single string is "10 Downing Street, Whitehall, London, SW1", the program should print out
					<br>10 Downing Street
					<br>Whitehall
					<br>London
					<br>SW1
				<p>Write a webpage containing a form that allows a user to enter an address.  When the user clicks submit, call the PHP program above to format the address and display it.
			</div>

			<div class="well">
			<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p>
				Create a database table in MySQL (using your university PHPMyAdmin account) containing data for employees of PHPCo. Ltd., such as:
				<table class="table">
					<tr>
						<th>Name</th>
						<th>Dept.</th>
						<th>Salary</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Brian</td>
						<td>Sales</td>
						<td>30000</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Sally</td>
						<td>Operations</td>
						<td>50000</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cal</td>
						<td>Sales</td>
						<td>35000</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Jill</td>
						<td>Sales</td>
						<td>42000</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p> Write a PHP program that will take the name of a dept. and print out all employees in that dept. and their salary.  Write a webpage containing a form that allows users to enter a dept. name and submit it to the PHP program.  In other words, users should be able to enter a dept. name, click submit and then see all employees in that dept. and their salaries.
			</div>

			<div class="well">
			<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong></p>
				<p>Change your code for Exercise 2 so that it is object-oriented.  Create an Employee class which holds the name, dept and salary values.  When the results are returned from the database, use the values in each row to create an Employee object which is added to an array.  Then iterate over the array of employee objects, printing out the name, dept and salary in the object

			<h3>Week 2 Tutorial</h3>
<div class="well">
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p>
<p>An independent cinema wants a web application that will list all the 
upcoming movies and the dates when they will play.  You can use a 
database table, or a file, or even just a PHP array, to hold the data.  
The movie data should include title, rating, genre (independent, 
foreign, action, comedy etc.) and dates when it is shown.
</p><p>Write a PHP program that lists the movies being shown by the 
cinema.  Try to use classes to structure your application (e.g., a Movie
 class)
</p><p>Add this link at the top of your HTML code for the webpage:
</p><pre><code>
&lt;link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
</code>
</pre>
and investigate how to use the bootstrap CSS framework to help layout the HTML (the bootstrap website is <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">here</a>).

<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p>
The cinema now want a web application that allows people to search for 
particular films, based on genre or rating.  Write a form that allows 
people to search and a web application that uses that data to display a 
list of matching films.

Install CodeIgniter in your university public_html directory, and check 
that you can run it.  See the online notes for instructions on installation and running the default Codeigniter application.
<p>Explore the code for the Codeigniter application you have installed.  Find the file containing the `Welcome` controller.  Read through the code and locate the line of code that is responsible for creating the view.  Locate the file containing the code for the view.  Edit the view and re-run your application.  Check that you can see your changes in the browser.
